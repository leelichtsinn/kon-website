I'm Lee Lichtsinn. Originally from Minnesota, I now live in Brooklyn.
For the time being, I work for a building code and zoning consultant as a filing representative.
I also work as a volunteer for the public access television show ESP T.V.
Outside of work I play music with friends, read manga, study Japanese, and spend too much time playing video games.
